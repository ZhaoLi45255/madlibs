A vacation is when you take a trip to some _ADJ place
with your _ADJ family. Usually you go to some place
that is near a _NOUN or up on a _NOUN.
A good vacation place is one where you can ride _PLN
or play _NOUN or go hunting for _PLN. I like
to spend my time _ING or _ING.
When parents go on a vacation, they spend their time eating
three _PLN a day, and fathers play golf, and mothers
sit around _ING. Last summer, my little brother
fell in a/an _NOUN and got poison _NOUN all
over his _N. My family is going to go to the _NOUN, and I will practice _ING. Parents
need vacations more than kids because parents are always very
_ADJ and because they have to work _NUM
hours every day all year making enough _PLN to pay
for the vacation.
