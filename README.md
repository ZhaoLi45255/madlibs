# madlibs
This is a Python program for playing Mad Libs. There are two modes: Easy Mode and Random Mode. 

In Easy Mode, users simply are asked certain questions such as "name an adjective". No matter how many times they play it, the questions will always remain the same for
one file.

In Random Mode, the questions are randomized every time, so users will not always get the same questions.

You can put in your own file for the program to play Mad Libs with. For Easy Mode, all word replacements use tags from the NLTK library. For example, for an adjective,
replace the word with "JJ". Do not do this to any documents for Random Mode.
